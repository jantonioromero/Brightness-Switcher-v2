# Brightness-Switcher-v2

This is a simple application to change the brightness level of the screen with a single touch. It includes a widget which acts as the switch, and a configuration screen which allows you to define several (up to 10) levels of brightness. Each touch of the widget will switch to the next level in the list.

This is a (much needed) update on an old project, originally created with Eclipse.
